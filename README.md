Simple UI for docker
====================

How to run
----------
This is a Beego app, so you have to go to your "Go"/src directory, clone this git project and launch it:
```bash
# something like this...
cd ~/gowork/src
git clone https://bitbucket.org/mnlab-dev/rpi_docker_ui.git
cd rpi_docker_ui
bee run watchall # this runs at port 8080
```
